                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hi, I am Bernadette Nyam,
                        a Religious woman and a clinical
                        psychologist. I am passionate about
                        God, People, Nature and how a healthy
                        relationship between all three can lead
                        to personal integration and wholeness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I work to achieve this in myself and to
                        help others achieve it in themselves;
                        through Psychotherapy, Spiritual direction
                        and Workshops.

        <h1>Living Life to the fullest</h1>
        <p>
            Life is hard but liveable.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is so easy for some people to stop at the first phrase that "life is hard" and not proceed to the second
            part which says “but liveable” why is it that some people are destroyed by challenges, traumatic
            experiences, difficulties etc while some people use them as stepping stones to better their lives and
            develop latent potentials. Why do people commit suicide?
        </p>
        <p>
            What aspects of myself, what innate qualities help me to be resilient, relate well with self and others? How does all
            these impact the world around me and the whole of creation?
        </p>
        <p>
            These are some questions that have puzzled me as a Religious woman, an African, a clinical psychologist, a
            person interested in ecology and sustainable farming.
        </p>
        <p>
            My life and work has been about trying to answer these questions for myself and by doing so I am finding
            meaning or what I prefer to call fullness of life. My goal is to share this knowledge and experiences with
            others and help them find same.
        </p>
